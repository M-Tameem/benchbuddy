# BenchBuddy - a project for BenchSci

initial prototype for benchsci to pitch the idea. 

a good team isn't just a set of incredibly talented technical people - according to a study done on best-performing team management in Google, Apple, Microsoft, and other big companies found that personality chemistry and work ethic chemistry can, on average, increase productivity by ~70%.

BenchBuddy is a way to optimize the team creation process for project managers.

creates and interacts w/ Slack API (on a pvt slack server) to analyze employee messages.

frontend made with streamlit, allows project managers to choose the "type" of project + how many people are needed.

SVM + BERT and a custom optimization algo picks out the best set of people for the job based on both personality traits and chemistry, and technical skills.
